# Coding Style
My personal coding style; used in every language I write.

## Indentation
Always 2 spaces.

## Line length
79 chars.

## Wrapping
Always after an operator or comma.
Either add 1 more space indentation or line-up code.

## Spaces
Never inside parens. (x)
Always inside/around curlies. { x }
Always around operators.
Always after a comma, never before.

## Block Brackets
Open always on same line.
Block starts on newline.
Close on newline.

x =  {
    y
}

## Comments
All comments provide context.
They should never explain 'what' but 'why'.

### Headers
Always 72 char long.
Never include authors, dates, fixes, etc. (that's what Git is for)
Mention referals (e.g. where does this function get called)
Explain parameters and result if needed (when not obvious from code)
Provide uri (source).

### to-do's
Only use TODO, not HACK, not BUGFUX etc.
If a TODO refers to an issue, use either the full uri or the issue number with a hash-sign (#456)

### Dividers
Always 72 char long.
--- for subsections
=== for main sections

## Naming conventions
- Always use names that describe purpose.
- Don't use abbreviations or acronyms unless very, very common.
- Only use standard ASCII chars
- Always in english
- Don't use i, j, k, etc. be descriptive at all times!
- unused vaiables may be named _
- Avoid words with double meaning. E.g. 'number' may refer to 'number of' (use amount or count instead) or 'the number' (use e.g. index instead or be more specific like house_number).
- Put aggregations (e.g. count or amount) at the end of a name. Use only standard abbreviations min, max, avg
- Include units if ambiguous e.g. temperature_in_celcius
- When casting, include the type e.g. length_as_string
- Avoid vague words like 'manager', 'get', 'value', 'data', 'info' etc.
- Avoid relative words like 'new', 'old', 'final', 'previous' etc.

### Variables & Properties
snake_case
In general they should start with a noun and be singular.
E.g. passenger_seat_amount

#### Booleans
Should start with is_, has_ or can_ and should describe the 'true' state.
E.g. has_seats

#### Arrays
Should be plural. Associative arrays should contain both key and value.
E.g. customers_names_to_phonenumbers

### Constants
SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

### Function & Methods
camelCase
In general should start with a verb and contain a noun.
E.g. increaseNumberOfPassengerSeats

If it returns a boolean it should start with is, has or can
And should test for a 'true' state.
E.g. isTurnedOn

### Classes, Objects & Modules
PascalCase
In general they consist of a noun or an ajective + noun.
E.g. Cat, BigCat.

### URI's
Mostly contextual. If possible, use snake-case.

### Filenames
Classes & Modules must have the same filename as the Class or Module, using the same case. Other files use snake-case.


## Project file-tree
Projects
-- name-of-project
----- bin (or dist. what is distributed/released)
----* doc (all documents related to project)
----- ext (external libraries, dependencies, etc.)
----- ide (or build. files generated by the ide or compiler or tools)
----- res (resources like reference materials, config files, data or images)
----* src (or dev. this is the working directory)
----- tst (tests)
----* README.md
----* Changlog.txt
----* .gitignore

*) are placed under version control, the rest is not.

## Returns
I'm not a "there can only be one return" purist. Multiple exit-points from a function can be preferred (e.g. using a Guard). However, I do tend to try to return at the end as much as possible. (avoiding spagetti code).

## Anonymous functions (lambda's)
Avoid them. Only use them if the function is not used anywhere else and it does not contain more than 3 lines of code max.

## One function
Every function, method, class, module and file should do one thing or contain logical grouped code.
Better to have multiple small functions than one big function.

### Grouping caveats
Group logic based on readability over function.

## Magic numbers
Never use literals if a constant or option/setting can do.
Parameterize as much as possible.
